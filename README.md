# My Relevant Work Thus Far:

### [COVID-19 Statistical Analysis Project](https://github.com/TheDoff/COVIDWastewaterEMRProject):
In the Spring of 2024, I took on an ambitious project in my Statistical Practicum (STAT 460) class to analyze the relationship between the viral activity of COVID-19 in wastewater and change in excess mortality (both at the national level). The primary goal of this analysis was to see if we could predict the rise/fall in excess mortality using changes in levels of COVID-19 found in wastewater. This project leveraged my R programming skills that I learned and strengthened in Applied Regression Analysis (STAT 320), Data Visualization and Communication (STAT 336), and Computational Statistics and Analytics (STAT 360) to a data type that I had little experience with (but would quickly familiarize myself both in this and my computer science capstone project): time series. The largest struggle with this (and most statistical analysis) projects revolved around the collection and cleaning of the data we needed which was hosted on multiple sites (CDC NWSS and CDC Wonder). Ensuring dates were formatted correctly was a problem encountered early on that would later resurface in my CISC capstone project, as the latter would also necessitate proper style of dates to allow for charting of student commit data. The following analysis proved quite simple computationally but conceptionally my mind had to wrap around ARIMA (autoregressive integrated moving average, used for predicting future time series data using one dataset) and VAR (vector autoregression, used for predicting future time series data using multiple datasets), the two primary statistical tools used in the analysis. As a data science major (in addition to computer science), this project served as the culmination of my statistical programming prowess while also serving a greater good in early disease warning (as our created models had high predictive/explanatory power).
